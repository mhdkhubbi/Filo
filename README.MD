📁# **File Manager** — Training Project
A learning-focused Android app built with curiosity, patience, and a lot of love ❤️
This project is a personal exploration of modern Android development using Jetpack Compose, Kotlin Coroutines, and high‑performance file APIs. It’s not intended for production use — instead, it serves as a hands‑on playground to experiment, break things, fix them, and grow as a developer.

🚀 # **Tech Stack & Core Features & UI**

- Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
Modern declarative UI with dynamic theming and smooth animations.
Navigation
- Navigation 3
Using the experimental runtime + UI APIs for a fully Compose‑native navigation flow.
Architecture
- UDF (Unidirectional Data Flow)
Backed by Kotlin Coroutines for predictable state management and clean async handling.
Core Android APIs
- Media API — Efficient access to images, videos, and media metadata
- java.nio.file (Path API) — High‑performance file operations
- Background workers for IO tasks and staggered loading

⚠️ # **Project Status**
This app is for experiments and training, not production. Some features are intentionally incomplete or still evolving.
- Search
The UI is implemented, but the actual search logic is not yet functional.
- File Opening
Opening files internally or via external apps is not implemented yet.
- Optimization
While IO performance has been improved, deeper refactoring and tuning are still needed.
- Work in Progress
Several UI components and edge‑case behaviors for file operations are still being refined.

📱 # **Android Version Support**
This project supports:
- Android 11 (API 30) and above

❤️# **Purpose**
This project is built with curiosity, patience, and a genuine desire to learn. It’s a safe space to experiment with modern Android tools, explore architecture patterns, and practice building a real‑world‑style file manager — all crafted with love.
