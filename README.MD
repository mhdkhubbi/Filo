⚠️ Project Status (Known Limitations)
This project is for experiments and training . Please note the following:
1.
Search: The search feature UI is present but the functional logic is not yet implemented.
2.
File Opening: The ability to open files within the app or trigger external intents to open files in other apps is not yet enabled.
3.
Optimization: While many IO optimizations have been made (background workers, staggered loading), the project requires further refactoring and deep-level performance tuning.
4.
Work in Progress: Some UI components and edge-case handling for file operations are still being refined.
